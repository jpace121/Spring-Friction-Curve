#Spring-Friction-Curve#

##Description##

This project models the situation and tries to solve the problem desribed in the following problem statement:   

The mechanism in the figure needs to be designed so as to capture parcels at A and to deliver them at B. The impact speed at B must not exceed 1.5 m/s. The parcels have masses ranging between 5 and 10 kg incoming at speeds ÔÅµ0 between 3 and 6 m/s. Determine the acceptable ranges of the spring constant, the free length of the spring, and the kinetic friction coefficient between the sliding surface and the cradle to achieve the desired result.

Based on the results, there are probably no possible solutions to this problem.

##Installation##

Compilation tested on Mac OSX using clang.  Using **make** compile with:
```
make all
```

No guarantee code will compile with any other compilers on any other operating systems. (I'm ~90% sure it won't work on Windows.)

##Use##

After compilation run the resultant program with: 

```
./mathtest
```

Lots of content will fill the screen.

Look at the source code comments for details on what to change for certain effects.  It's my intention that the comments are hopefully helpful enough to allow easy modification.  

If you need help, feel free to file an Issue.
