#DraftCode#

This folder includes various other programs written to solve the main problem before I tried writing the program in C.

The progression went something like Python -> Matlab -> C.

One interesting thing to note is I didn't catch I mixed up v_final and v_initial until way late in the game, though it probably should've been clear from the Matlab code.
